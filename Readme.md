Deep Learning for analysis of MNIST dataset
Apply a Deep Learning model to your project data (if possible). You can use another data set ONLY if it makes no sense to use a Deep Learning model for your project.
PART A - DEEP LEARNING MODEL 
On your project data
•	Apply a Deep Learning model to your project data (if possible). Validate the accuracy.
•	The Deep Learning model can be a CNN, RNN, Autoencoder, Variational autoencoder (VAE), Restricted Boltzmann machine (RBM), Deep belief network (DBN) or Generative Model. It cannot be a simple multilayer perceptron (MLP).
PART B - ACTIVATION FUNCTION 
On your Deep Learning model data
•	Change the activation function. How does it effect the accuracy?
•	How does it effect how quickly the network plateaus?
•	Various activation functions:
•	Rectified linear unit (ReLU)
•	TanH
•	Leaky rectified linear unit (Leaky ReLU)
•	Parameteric rectified linear unit (PReLU)
•	Randomized leaky rectified linear unit (RReLU)
•	Exponential linear unit (ELU)
•	Scaled exponential linear unit (SELU)
•	S-shaped rectified linear activation unit (SReLU)
•	Identity
•	Binary step
•	Logistic
•	ArcTan
•	Softsign
•	Adaptive piecewise linear (APL)
•	SoftPlus
•	SoftExponential

PART C - COST FUNCTION
On your Deep Learning model data
•	Change the cost function. How does it effect the accuracy?
